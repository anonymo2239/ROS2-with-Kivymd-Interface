# ROS2-with-Kivymd-Interface
 I managed to communicate between two nodes using ROS2 with kivymd. In this code, when pushed start button the communicate will start.
 
 LITTLE FOOTNOTE
 It doesn't work the first time it is pressed, it starts working if it is pressed a second time. Other than that, there is no problem. I used Threading method. If you have anything that you want to add please do not hesitate...
